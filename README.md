# Spotify-like Music Player

Welcome to the Spotify-like music player! This is a simple web-based music player that allows users to play, pause, and navigate through a list of songs, similar to the functionality found in popular music streaming apps like Spotify.

## Features

- **Play/Pause:** Toggle between play and pause for the currently playing song.
- **Next/Previous Song:** Skip to the next or previous song in the playlist.
- **Progress Bar:** Track the progress of the current song with a seekable progress bar.
- **Song List:** View a list of songs with their names and cover images.
- **Song Selection:** Click on any song to play it, and the master play button will update accordingly.

## How It Works

1. **Song List Display:**
   The program initializes a list of songs with their names, file paths, and cover images. These are dynamically displayed on the webpage.

2. **Play/Pause Button:**
   The master play button controls the playing and pausing of the audio. When clicked, it will play the song if it's paused, or pause the song if it's currently playing.

3. **Progress Bar:**
   The progress bar updates as the song plays, showing how far the song has progressed. The user can also click on the progress bar to jump to a specific part of the song.

4. **Next/Previous Buttons:**
   The next and previous buttons allow users to navigate through the song list and play the next or previous song.

5. **Song Selection:**
   Clicking on a song's play button will start playing that song, updating the master play button, song name, and progress bar accordingly.
